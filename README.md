#HydraX

HydraX is an AI-powered sustainability tool that helps the city of London, UK measure and visualize their rainwater harvesting potential.
By combining open-source environmental data with geospatial analytics, HydraX calculates how much rainwater could be collected from rooftops, visualizing the potential savings in both liters of water and reduced stormwater runoff.


🧠 Project Overview

Urban areas lose millions of liters of clean rainwater every year due to inefficient drainage and lack of collection systems.
HydraX provides city planners and sustainability teams with data-driven insights on:

How much rainwater can be harvested city-wide or per district.

Which rooftops offer the highest collection potential.

How rainfall patterns and urban density affect sustainable water planning.



⚙️ Features

🏠 Rooftop analysis: Calculates roof surface areas using OpenStreetMap or satellite data.

🌧️ Rainfall integration: Pulls real precipitation data (e.g., NASA GPM or Open-Meteo).

💧 Water yield modeling: Estimates collection potential (m³/year).

🗺️ Interactive map: Visualizes high-impact collection zones.

🔮 Future expansion: Predictive rainfall models and smart efficiency optimization using AI.
